Travel Boo is a travel website.

I am using it to showcase some of my programming experience.

Right now it only has a simple register, login, and checkout page.

I use mySql with PHP to authenticate the users.

You will need to create your own database and make a 'user' table with an email and password column.

I built this rather quickly, and plan to add more functionality to showcase that I fully understand the process of authentication
